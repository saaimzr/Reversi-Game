<h1>Reversi Game</h1>


<h2>Introduction and Rules</h2>
Challenge a high-speed, advanced computer AI in Reversi! Here’s a quick overview of the rules:
<br><br>
- The game starts on an 8x8 board with 4 tiles in the center, arranged in an alternating black and white pattern. Moves must stay within columns "a" through "h." 
<br><br>
- To make a valid move, place a tile so that in at least one of the eight possible directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW), there’s a continuous line of one or more opponent’s tiles followed by one of your own. All opponent’s tiles in this line will be "flipped" to your color.
<br><br>
- If a player has no valid moves, the other player continues until the first player has an available move. The game ends when the board is full or both players have no moves left. The winner is determined by the highest tile count or by avoiding invalid moves.
